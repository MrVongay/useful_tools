When registering your bot, the HTTPS Message Endpoint is the URL from your Azure web app (found in the Web Apps Overview section). You will need to add /api/messages to the end of the URL.

You will also need to add the generated MICROSOFT_APP_ID and MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD to your Web Appâ€™s Application Settings. You can do this by going to the App settings section where the Key is MICROSOFT_APP_ID and Value is the generated ID. Repeat for MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD.

You also need your PMC_USERNAME, PMC_PASSWORD, and PMC_APP_ID.  You can either enter these as environment variables, or directly edit the top of the app.js file.
