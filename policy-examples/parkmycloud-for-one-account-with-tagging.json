This policy is very similar, but leverages a special tag "parkmycloud":"yes" to grant permissions to park instances. (Of course you can substititute any tag key:value pair you prefer, instead.) If the instance does not have the specified tag, then the user will NOT be allowed to park the instance.


NOTE: Your acount number is the 12-digit number found in the User ARN string. For example:

User ARN: arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:user/ernie

The account number would be 0123456789012
